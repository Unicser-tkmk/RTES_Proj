## Main Functions
### Tremor detection
Our device can identify the frequency and how long it last of the user's movement. By doing this, we can accurately detect if a tremor is happened, and prevent mistakenly trigger the alarm.
### Body movement detection
Our device will detect if the user is moving since resting tremors are visible at rest and occur when a body part (usually the hand or
wrist) is completely supported, and is minimal or absent during activity. 
### Intensity Identification
Our device can detect the intensity of a detected tremor, and use different ways to notify the situation.
We use static red light to inform a detected tremor, and a flashing red light to inform a serious tremor.
